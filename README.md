## 1. What is a Network?

A network consists of two or more computers that are linked in order to share resources (such as printers and CDs), exchange files, or allow electronic communications. The computers on a network may be linked through cables, telephone lines, radio waves, satellites, or infrared light beams.
- Two very common types of networks include:
  *  Local Area Network(LAN)
  * Wide Area Network (WAN)
  
##2. Common physical component of a network
- PC: the devices which act as the end points in a network ( their reponsibilities are sending and receiving data), also they are severs.
- Interconnections: Consist of components which acts as the means to transfer data from one point to another in a network, includes :
  * Network interface card : translating data in to a format to be transferred over a network.
  * Network media : consting of cables or wireless media providing means for signals to be transmitted.   
  * Connectors : providing connection points for the media.
- Switches : The end systems are usually connected to switches which faccilities intellegent swiching of data whithin a local network.
- Routers : be used to connect different network together and they support to choose the best path for data transfer between two networks.
- WLAN Devices : Wireless LAN of WAN devices conect network devices.

## 4.Resource-sharing functions and benefits
- Data and application : users can share files, sofwaves application program.
- Resource: including input devices and output devices.
- Network storage: Direct attached storage (DAS), network attched storage (NAS), storage area network (SANs)
- Backup devices: (such as tape drivers) providing a central means to save files from multiple computers, archiving capability, business continuance, and recovering disaster.
